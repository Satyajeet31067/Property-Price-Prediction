# Property-Price-Prediction
This project involves predicting property prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as location, size, and proximity to amenities, which are preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical data effectively. The model is trained using algorithms like Linear Regression, and its performance is evaluated through metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). This project aims to provide accurate property price predictions, offering valuable insights for real estate planning and decision-making.
